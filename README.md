# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) problem that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand and interpret the subjective information present in the text, typically classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. The sentiment analysis problem is challenging due to the nuances of human language, including sarcasm, irony, and context-dependent expressions. NLP models for sentiment analysis often use machine learning techniques, including supervised learning with labeled datasets, and may leverage pre-trained language models to capture contextual information effectively. This task is crucial in understanding public opinion, customer feedback, social media trends, and other areas where analyzing sentiment can provide valuable insights.
